# Verto

> A multi-currency cross-blockchain peer-to-peer wallet with initial support for 
VTX Bitcoin Bitcoincash Dash EOS Ethereum Litecoin and Neo

Verto is being built as a multi-currency wallet
for use with the VDex decentralized exchange,
and intends to facilitate personal custody and
local management of private and public keys
in peer-to-peer transactions, with the goal of
eliminating the risks of devastating losses of
stake associated with traumatic failures of central
operators. 
Verto plans to employ a system of smart contracts to maintain the state between two
trading clients, the simplest operations being accomplished with atomic swaps [Volentix ecosystem](https://volentix.io).
