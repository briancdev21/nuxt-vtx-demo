# Verto

> A multi-currency crypto wallet with initial support for EOS & VTX

Verto is a wallet which will connect closely with VDex, the Volentix decentralized
cryptocurrency exchange. Users with their funds in Verto will be able to maintain
custody of their private keys and their funds in Verto, while being able to buy and
sell crypto without depositing their own funds in the exchange.

The goal of the first version of Verto is to hold VTX, which is the native currency
of the [Volentix ecosystem](https://volentix.io). VTX is a currency based on EOS, and so
the wallet actually hold EOS tokens.
