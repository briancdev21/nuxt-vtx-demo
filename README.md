> A multi-currency crypto wallet with initial support for EOS & VTX

Verto is a wallet which will connect closely with VDex, the Volentix decentralized
cryptocurrency exchange. Users with their funds in Verto will be able to maintain
custody of their private keys and their funds in Verto, while being able to buy and
sell crypto without depositing their own funds in the exchange.

Security is the foremost consideration of Verto. The wallet encourages good practices
such as disconnecting from the internet when generating private keys and writing
the seed phrase on paper. Private keys are generated locally and never sent to any
external entity.

The goal of the first version of Verto is to hold VTX, which is the native currency
of the [Volentix ecosystem](https://volentix.io). VTX is a currency based on EOS, and so
the wallet actually hold EOS tokens.
